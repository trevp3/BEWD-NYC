#Final Project Proposal

##Name:
New Clothes Network

##Summary:
Links nonprofit shelters and thrift stores in NYC to clothing retailers, facilitating easy donation of new, clean, in-style clothes.

##Mission:
New Clothes Network is a direct action tool that takes redistribution of clothing stock out of the hands of corporate management, where it simply doesn’t happen, and into the willing hands of retail workers, nonprofits, and volunteers.

Daily, large chain clothing retailers like Urban Outfitters and H&M not only throw their overstock away, but destroy it first to ensure it can’t be rescued.  Meanwhile, New York shelters like New Alternatives for LGBT Homeless Youth are desperate for clothing donations.

Some retailers will allow their overstock to be donated to 501(c)(3) nonprofits, but only on the condition that the stock is picked up within a window of time; there is no consistent method--and many have no method at all--of announcing overstock availability.  Once the window closes, the stock is destroyed.

Shelters typically receive too many clothing donations around the holidays, and not enough the rest of the year.  Donations are often shabby, out of style, or unwashed.  People without homes are as deserving of new, current clothes as people with homes, and presentability is critical for accessing housing and employment.  New Clothes Network redistributes perfectly good clothes that would otherwise land sliced up in the trash to those who need and deserve them.

Nonprofit resellers like Housing Works and Angel Street Thrift Shop can accept not only clothes but other stock as well, and have the additional ability to transform overstock into cash, which helps the community in even more ways.

##How It Works:
Any employee can register their retail location, and each location can have multiple employee users.  When overstock is available, the employee uses New Clothes Network's mobile-responsive site to submit a simple form that collects stock information like season and style, plus deadline for pickup.

Nonprofits can browse available pickups on the site, but the real benefit comes from email alerts.  After registering with their proof of 501(c)(3) status (which many retailers require for pickup) they choose their alert schedule.  Contacts receive targeted alerts for stock available in their area at that time.  With a click, they reserve stock for two hours.  If someone else reserves first, the organization is automatically added to a waiting list, and will be notified if the stock is still available in 2 hours.

When an organization arrives to pick up stock, they show their proof of 501(c)(3) on the New Clothes Network site from a phone or tablet.  Either the collector or the retail employee can check in the pickup.  This cancels any other holds, takes the stock offline, and generates an email tax receipt to both the organization and the retailer.

New Clothes Network also offers a unique volunteer opportunity by allowing practically anyone to pick up for an organization.  Volunteers submit a short request which nonprofits can accept with a click, and approved volunteers receive the same alerts the nonprofit has already scheduled.  The organization is notified when a volunteer reserves a pickup and again when it's checked in, and has the volunteer’s contact information for accountability purposes.  Volunteers can pick up even when no nonprofit staff are available or their office is closed, and can coordinate a later drop-off with the organization.

Organizations have the option to suspend notifications and reservations if they are not accepting donations at that time, which removes volunteers’ ability to reserve as well.
