**Name:** Direct Cremation *(Final Name TBD)*
Introduction: Funeral costs are the largest single expense that most families pay after a house and car. Nearly everyone in the world will have to make arrangements for the loss of a relative or for themselves. Funeral costs are “buried” with superfluous expenses, middlemen, and inefficient local-run companies, although most of the products and services funeral homes offer are performed regionally by large companies. Cremations are growing in popularity instead of burial, but most people still work make arrangements through a funeral home for a very costly markup.

*Direct Cremation* will offer cremations from national providers, saving customers thousands of dollars. The website will allow customers to enter valid order, service, and billing information at their own pace, order extras, and submit orders for processing.

**Target Audience:** The MVP will validate details for customers in the United States

**Third Party Services:** Sensitive billing information will be handled by a 3rd party for government and payment processor compliance. Email receipts and marketing email may be handled through a 3rd party if needed. Digital document signing and form creation can be handled through an API if time permits. Order submission may occur through an email gateway, fax gateway, or API if available.
